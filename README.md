  Artemis I mission GraphQL Sever with NASA Horizons data
</p>

## ðŸ“¦ Purpose

This project is a GraphQL server that allows you to query real-time and historical data from certain data obtained from NASA Horizons for the Artemis I mission.

The server takes the information from a CSV from September 27 to November 5 with a step of 1 minute (one row per minute) from a geocentric observer to the Orion spacecraft. Ready to be sent to NASA Open MCT connected with the Graphem plugin.

The information was collected with NASA Horizons.
